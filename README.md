# BatLife

 ### arduino in VSCODE/platformio



This program will be used to test batteries from a specific light source, mainly gun based lights to test the life expectancy of batteries. I made this program inorder to test different types of batteries in a gun mounted light to see what batteires work best with my light and see what batteries have the longest life.



Arduino uno was used for testing



Calibration code is included to see what you need to set your thresholds at



Future updates : Adding a LCD, adding LEDS to verify that the program is running.
